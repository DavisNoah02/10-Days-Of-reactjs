# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## Arrays, Lists, and Dictionaries in JavaScript

### Arrays
Arrays in JavaScript are used to store multiple values in a single variable. They are created using square brackets `[]`.

```javascript
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
console.log(fruits[0]); // Output: Apple
```

### Lists
In JavaScript, lists are essentially arrays. You can perform various operations like adding, removing, and iterating over elements.

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
numbers.push(6); // Adds 6 to the end of the array
console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

### Dictionaries (Objects)
Dictionaries in JavaScript are called objects. They store data in key-value pairs.

```javascript
let person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  city: "New York"
};
console.log(person.name); // Output: John
```
